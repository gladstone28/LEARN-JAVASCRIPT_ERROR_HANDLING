### LEARN JAVASCRIPT: ERROR HANDLING

## Error Handling Review

Great job with handling errors!

In this lesson we went over:

- How mistakes in programming leads to errors.
- Why errors are useful for developers.
- Errors will prevent a program from executing unless it is handled.
- How to create an error using the Error() function.
- How to throw an error object using the throw keyword.
- How to use the try...catch statement to handle thrown errors.
- Evaluating code in a try block to anticipate errors.
- Catching the error in a catch block to allow our program to continue running.
- Why the try...catch statement would be useful in a program.
Now you have the ability to create code that doesnâ€™t break when an error is thrown!


### Instructions

If you want to challenge yourself:

- Force different built-in error object to be thrown in a try...catch statement and see when the messages are different.
- Test out what different data types you can throw.
- Use try...catch for a function that accepts user input to allow errors to be thrown but your program to continue running.
